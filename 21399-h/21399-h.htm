<h2>A WORD TO PARENTS.</h2>


<p>The story of &ldquo;Dick Whittington and his
Cat&rdquo; has so often amused the little ones, who
never wearied of its repetition, that the author
of the following version thought she might
extend the pleasure derived from it by putting
it in language which they could read for
themselves.</p>

<p>No word contains more than <i>four letters</i>,
and none is over <i>one syllable</i> in length, so that
any child who has the least knowledge of
reading will be able to enjoy it for himself.</p>

<p><span class="dropcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>nce on a time,
a poor boy was
seen to go up and
down the side-walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
of a town,
and sob and cry.
At last he sat
down on a door-step.
He was too
weak to run more.
He had had no
food all the day.
It was a day in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
June. The air
was mild. The
warm sun sent
down its rays of
love on all. But
poor Dick had no
joy on this fair
day.</p>

<p>He laid his head
down on the step,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
and took a nap;
for he was sick
and weak for want
of food. As he
lay, a girl came
to the door. She
saw the poor boy
lie on the step;
but he did not see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
her. She went
in, and said to a
man who was in
the room, &ldquo;A poor
boy has lain down
on our step to
take a nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man came
to the door to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
the boy. He said,
&ldquo;This boy does
not look nice.
His hair has not
seen a comb all
day; his face and
feet are full of
dirt; and his coat
is torn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
The man did
not like such a
mean boy to be
at his door. But
when he saw the
lad&#8217;s thin, pale
face, as he lay at
his feet, he felt
sad for him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
Just then the
boy woke up. He
went to run off
when he saw the
man and girl at
the door, but they
made him stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you
lie down here?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
the man said to
the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was weak
and sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had
no food to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had no
food all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
went in and got
him a roll and
a mug of milk.
The boy ate so
fast and so much
that they had to
wait till he was
done, to talk to
him more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
&ldquo;Have you no
pa nor ma?&rdquo; said
the man. A tear
fell from the poor
boy&#8217;s eye, as he
said, &ldquo;I have no
pa, and my ma
they took from
me, and I can not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
find her. She
was sick a long
time. I used to
sit at her side and
lay my head on
her knee. Once
she said to me
that my pa had
gone home to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
God, and that
she must go too.
Then she got too
sick to rise from
her bed. One
day they put me
on the bed by her
side. She laid
her hand on my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
head, and she
said, &ldquo;I pray
Thee, O God,
take care of my
poor boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she shut
her eyes and grew
so pale, and her
hand got so cold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
it made me cry.
But she did not
move, nor turn
her eyes on me.
They took me off
the bed and sent
me out to play.
But I sat down
at the door and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
wept for my ma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day
I saw them lay
her in a long box
of wood and take
her off. I have
run up and down
all day to find
her. Do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
know what they
have done with
my ma? Oh! tell
me, if you can.&rdquo;
Then the poor
lad wept so hard
that the man and
the girl felt sad
for him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
&ldquo;How old are
you, my boy?&rdquo;
said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was six last
May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dick,&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
said this good
man, &ldquo;you may
come in here, if
you like, and stay
till you can find
your ma. I will
give you food to
eat, and you can
help me to work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
When your ma
does come for
you, you may go
home with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick soon made
up his mind to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
live with this kind,
good man. The
man was not rich.
He had to work
hard, and Dick
was made to work
too. But he did
not mind that.</p>

<p>But the girl was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
not kind to Dick.
She gave him a
box on the ear
when he did not
do as she bid him.
She did not let
him sit down to
eat till she had
done, and all that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
she gave him was
the bits that she
had left. She
made him a bed
of a pile of old
rags, at one end
of the loft.</p>

<p>Dick had no
one now to show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
him how to be
good, and he soon
got to be a bad
boy. He told lies,
and when no eye
was on him, he
took what was not
his. He did not
know God saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
him. He used a
bad word now and
then, and did not
work so well as
once he did.</p>

<p>The man who
took Dick to live
with him was sad
to see him such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
bad boy, and did
not know what to
do with him.</p>

<p>Dick had now
no joy in life, for
no bad boy can
be gay and glad.
But he did not
like to feel that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
he was made sad
by his own bad
ways. He said
it was the way he
had to live that
made him bad.</p>

<p>Poor Dick had
now no one to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
love him but a cat.
One day, when he
was out at play,
he saw some boys
pelt a cat to kill
her. He did not
like to have them
kill the cat, so he
ran to her, took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
her up in his
arms, and took
her home. The
girl let him keep
the cat, for she
kept off all the
rats and mice.
She was a gray
cat. She had fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
soft fur, and a
long tail. When
Dick had done his
tea, he took puss
on his knee to pat
her on the head,
and talk to her,
as if she knew all
that he said to her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
She then did
rub her head on
his arm, and purr,
and lie down on
his knee and take
a nap. She had
her bed on his
heap of rags.</p>

<p>Once when Dick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
had felt bad all
day, he lay down
on his bed. He
said to puss, &ldquo;No
one is kind to me
but you, puss; no
one has love for
me. I will run off.
I will not stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
Dick did not
shut his eyes, but
when it was yet
dark, he got up,
and went out of
his room, down
to the door. He
put his hand on
the key and gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
it a turn. He felt
the cold air on
his face when he
went out. But
he ran on fast,
till he was so
weak, he had to
stop.</p>

<p>Just then a big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
bell near him
rang out loud on
the air to say that
day had come
once more. It
made Dick turn
his eyes to see
this bell, and as
it rang, he felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
it say to him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn back,
Dick!&mdash;Turn
back, Dick!&mdash;Turn
back, Dick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick did not
move. He did
not know what to
do. His eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
were on the bell
as it rung out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn back,
Dick!&mdash;Turn
back, Dick!
Turn back, Dick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It put him in
mind of the time
when his ma had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
laid her hand on
his head ere she
went to God, and
said, &ldquo;O God,
take care of my
poor boy!&rdquo; It
put him in mind
what a bad boy
he had been, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
how he had made
his life a hard
one by his ill
ways. He made
up his mind to go
back. But then
he said, &ldquo;If they
find out I have
run off, they will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
beat me.&rdquo; This
fear made him
run so fast, that
he got home and
back to his heap
of rags ere the
man and the girl
were up.</p>

<p>As Dick lay on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
his bed, he made
up his mind to be
a good boy. He
knew his ma used
to pray to God to
make him good,
so he bent his
own knee to pray,
and said, &ldquo;O God,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
make Dick a good
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the
girl came to the
door, and said,
&ldquo;Dick! Dick! get
up! It is day!&rdquo;
So Dick soon
went down and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
was so kind and
good, they did
not know what to
make of it. But
Dick went on day
by day, and soon
he saw that when
he was kind and
good, they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
kind and true to
him.</p>

<p>It was hard work
for Dick to give
up all his bad
ways. But each
morn and eve he
went to God, to
ask Him for help,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
and he did not
ask in vain. By-and-by
the girl
let him sit with
her. She made
him a good bed.
Miss Puss yet
kept her seat on
his knee, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
sat down to rest,
and all was love
and joy.</p>

<p>One day
a man, by

of Jack,
came to
see them.
He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
to go on the sea
in a big ship, to
a far off land.
He had come to
say good-bye.
He said to them,
&ldquo;The land that
the ship will sail
to, is a far off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
land, and the men
who live in it are
not like us, and
do not know our
ways. They do
not eat or wear
what we do. Now
what you give me
I will take with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
me, and sell it for
you, and when I
come back I will
pay you what I
get for it. It
may be that I
will get much
gold for it; for
the men in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
far off land like
what is made
here, more than
what they have
at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man and
the girl were glad,
and gave him
much to sell for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
them. Poor Dick
sat, with his cat on
his knee; a tear
was in his eye,
for he too felt the
wish to have some
gold. The man
saw him look sad,
and said, &ldquo;Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
Dick, my son,
and what will
you send?&rdquo; Dick
wept. &ldquo;I have
but my cat,&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;Well,
send that,&rdquo; said
Jack; &ldquo;it may be
she will sell for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
more than all the
rest.&rdquo; They all
had much fun at
this, and Dick
had to join in.
He took puss up
in his arms. He
gave her a kiss
and a pat on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
head. He felt
her soft fur. It
was hard for him
to part with her,
for she had been
his pet for a long
time. But at last
he set her down.
He got a big bag.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
He put puss in it.
She did not like
to be thus shut
up, but Dick tied
her in.</p>

<p>So the man took
the bag in his
arms, and went to
his ship. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
he got to the ship,
he let the cat out
of the bag. She
was glad to be
free once more,
and ran to find
Dick. But poor
Dick was at home,
sad; for he knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
that he had seen
his puss for the
last time.</p>

<p>The ship was
full of rats and
mice, and puss
had a fine time.
She made them
fly, and soon no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
more rats and
mice were to be
seen in the ship.
The men were
glad to have the
cat, and gave her
food and milk, so
that she was well
off.</p>

</div>


<p>The ship went
on her way. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
was more than a
year when they
got to that far off
land.</p>

<p>The man who
took the cat, had,
as was said, the
name of Jack.
He left the ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
when he got to
the land, and
went to see the
king. The king
was glad to see
Jack, and told
him, he must stay
and dine with
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
When they went
to the room to
dine, they saw
that rats and mice
were in it too, and
had eat much of
the food. They
saw the rats and
mice jump down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
and run when
they went in the
room.</p>

<p>The king was
in a rage, that he
had lost his meal.
Jack said to him,
&ldquo;Why do you let
the rats and mice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
do so?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do
not know how to
help it,&rdquo; said the
king. &ldquo;I will give
a pile of gold to
one who will rid
me of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Jack was
glad. He said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
the king, &ldquo;If you
will give me a
pile of gold, I will
rid you of the rats
and mice.&rdquo; The
king said, &ldquo;You
are in fun. You
do not know how
to get rid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
them.&rdquo; Jack said,
&ldquo;We will see.&rdquo;
So the next day,
he put the cat in
a bag, and went
with the bag in
his arm to the
king. Puss did
not like to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
shut up in the
bag, and made
much fuss.</p>

<p>The king was
glad to see Jack,
and said, &ldquo;Let
me see what you
have in your
bag.&rdquo; But Jack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
said, &ldquo;Not just
yet; wait till we
see the rats and
mice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went
to the room to
dine. The rats
and mice were at
the food just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
they had been.
Jack took the
cord off the bag,
and took out the
cat. The king
did not know
what a cat was;
for he had no
cats in his land.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
Jack held her
in his arms till
she had lost her
fear, and then set
her down with the
rats and mice.
She soon made
them know what
a cat was, and put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
them in such fear
that they all fled.
The king was so
glad that he did
not know what
to do.</p>

<p>They sat down
to dine. Not a
rat came out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
its hole. The
king ate his meal
with joy, and puss
sat on his knee
and fed out of his
dish. The king
told Jack he must
let him keep the
cat. Jack said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
&ldquo;I will give her
to you, but you
must give me the
pile of gold.&rdquo;
The king was
glad to keep the
cat and pay the
gold. So Jack
put the gold in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
the bag that had
held the cat, and
went back to the
ship.</p>

<p>A year more
went by, ere Jack
and his ship came
back to port. He
soon went to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
Dick, with the
bag of gold. The
man and the girl
were both glad to
find that Jack had
sold what they
gave him, and
that he had got
a good deal for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
them. But when
Jack told them
of the cat, and
took out the bag
of gold, they did
not know what to
say. And when
poor Dick was
told that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
all for him, he
had to cry for
joy, and all the
rest wept with
him, for they were
all fond of Dick
now, he had come
to be such a good
boy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, Dick,&rdquo;
said Jack, &ldquo;what
will you do with
all this gold? Let
us see what will
be best.&rdquo; So they
all said much, and
sat up till it was
late, to talk of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
Dick and his pile
of gold.</p>

<p>At last Dick
said, &ldquo;I will give
some of it to each
of you, who have
been so good and
kind to me. I
will take part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
the rest and lay
it out upon my
mind, that I may
be wise when I
grow to be a man.
And what is left
I will lay up, so
that when I am a
man, I will have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
it to work with,
that I may grow
to be rich; for to
be good, and wise,
and rich, is what
I wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all said
Dick knew what
was best. So that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
is what was done
with the pile of
gold that the king
gave for the cat.</p>
